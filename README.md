# fun
A beginning. As proof that I need help I am writing this all over.
I could scream, okay I did,I thought of throwing the computer over the balcony, it is too heavy.
Well, and awkward. In a chair so it would be a big throw. Plus innocents below. Mostly raccoons and squirrels.
I mean fun is when you know what you are doing. And that to me is magic.
I am on a very tight schedule and it is important. I posted on glitch and no idea what made it or what it looks like.
I know it isn't good.
I will post a key image if I figure it out. Otherwise some HTML from index, never heard of them and I have many now.
It did work once with a very litle.
So I wil post code if I can figure out how to and please, any and all suggestions.
I just know some computers have had an untimely fall. Grabbed the monitor, then thought no you can't 
play games are be artsy or anything much with no monitor. I know someone thast did that and said how did you know. I laughed 
a lot. Because I know snd I get it. Computers are also awesome and the things that you can do and much wonderful
I got called about a radio survey and said I don't listen. I alsmost said have you heard of Spotify,
but he sounded depressed and started out hopeful and I wanted to interupt his intro which was excellent
but I had to give him something. He didn't mean Spotify radio. Next TV wil get like that.He was so sad, oh, you don't.
At any rate after this spouting off please help.
